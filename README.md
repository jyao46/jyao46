## Hi, I'm Jessica! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior at UCLA studying Data Science and Economics, passionate about using AI and machine learning to solve real-world problems! I'm a big fan of creative problem-solving and building projects that make an impact, and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn, grow, and work with others.

ðŸ”­ I'm interested in the intersection of data science and economics/finance

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to do the worm

Check out my [REU Project](https://github.com/zclawr/deep-wind-model-dispatch) at Washington State University Vancouver, where I explored physics-based, probabilistic, and deep learning models to predict wind power generation!
